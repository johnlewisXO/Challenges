    <h1>Maxims of Baloo</h1>
    <p>All that is told here happened some time before
    <strong>Mowgli</strong> was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or
    revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the
    days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.
    The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so
    quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as
    much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own
    pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat
    the Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that
    can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their
    lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks
    of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena
    whom we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a
    great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black
    Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see
    how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head
    against a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to
    Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
    swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,
    the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws:
    how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how
    to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a
    hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang
    the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;
    and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he
    splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People
    like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an
    intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’
    Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is
    answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts
    outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me
    leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer
    is, ‘Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.’  </p>

    <p>All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn
    by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing
    over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one
    day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a
    temper, ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all
    the Law of the Jungle.’ </p>

    <p>‘But think how small he is,’ said the Black Panther,
    who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own
    way. ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’ </p>

    <p>‘Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?
    No. That is why I teach him these things, and th

    <p>‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’
    Bagheera grunted. ‘His face is all bruised today by
    thy— softness. Ugh.’ </p>

    <h2>‘Better he should</h2>

    <p>be bruised from head to foot by me
    who love him than that he should come to harm through
    ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly. ‘I am now
    teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall
    protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all
    that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now
    claim protection, if he will only remember the words,
    from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?’</p>

    <h3>‘Well, look to </h3>

    <p>it then that thou dost not kill the mancub.
    He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.
    But what are those Master Words? I am more likely to
    give help than to ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one paw
    and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
    of it—‘still I should like to know.’ </p>

    <h4>‘I will call </h4>

    <p>Mowgli and he shall say them—if he will.
    Come, Little Brother!’ </p>
